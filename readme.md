Use Case #18

1 Phase:

I did the main task without using "Terraform remote state is used with the selected Cloud applicable backend."

With ChatGPT, I wasted time ~40 min. (With procedures - create user, get the keys, set config, etc.)
The quality of the code from ChatGTP was perfect.

I did pause.

2 Phase: I met the issue in the point "Terraform remote state is used with the selected Cloud applicable backend."
I made that point from scratch, according to Terraform documentation. 
From the ChatGPT, I got only an example of a policy.
The time for Phase 2 ~2.30h.
